Simple multi-player game using processingjs.

This is an attempt to use AJAX, JavaScript & processingJS to design a multi player game.

Day 1 commentary:
    The local server cannot handle the AJAX requests at a rate > 10Hz.
    Maybe it is the constant access to the database that slows the process. Or it may be the request itself.
    The AJAX solution is not suitable.

     Next step TCP ?
